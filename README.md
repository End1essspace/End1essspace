**XCON | RX**

Engineering-focused developer building structured desktop systems, research pipelines, and practical automation tools.

I build software as **systems**, not feature collections.


**🧱 Philosophy**

* Clean layered architecture
* Strict separation of concerns
* Local-first storage
* Deep OS integration
* Stability over hype
* Releases over prototypes

I prioritize robustness, maintainability, and predictable behavior.


**🖥 X-SERIES — Production Systems**

Architected desktop applications with strong structure and upgrade discipline.

* **XClip** — Windows clipboard manager (Java + JavaFX, SQLite WAL, MSI)
* **XLedger** — Cross-platform finance system (.NET + Avalonia, MVVM)
* **XTimer** — Floating Windows timer (PyQt, tray, auto-update)


**🧪 R-SERIES — Research Engineering**

Exploratory systems focused on controlled design.

* **RVisionT** — Two-phase OCR pipeline (OpenCV + Tesseract)

Emphasis on heuristic scoring, search reduction, and failure control.


**🛠 X-LAB — Utilities**

Small, focused OS-level tools.
Minimal. Direct. Functional.


**🧠 Stack**

**Java · C# · Python · PowerShell**
JavaFX · Avalonia · PyQt
