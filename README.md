**XCON | RX**

Engineering-focused software developer building structured desktop systems, research pipelines, and practical automation tools.

I design software as systems — not as isolated features.


🧱 **Engineering Philosophy**

- Clean layered architecture
- Strict separation of concerns
- Local-first data storage
- OS-level integration
- Stability over hype
- Release discipline over prototypes

I value robustness, maintainability, and predictable behavior over “quick demos”.


🏗 **Ecosystem**

### 🖥 X-SERIES — Production Desktop Systems

Engineered applications built with strong architectural discipline.

- **XClip** — Windows clipboard manager (Java 17 + JavaFX, SQLite WAL, MSI packaging)
- **XLedger** — Cross-platform finance manager (.NET 9 + Avalonia, MVVM, SQLite)
- **XTimer** — Floating Windows taskbar timer (PyQt, tray integration, auto-update)

Focus:
- Layered design
- Native OS integration
- Local data persistence
- Upgrade-safe packaging


🧪 **R-SERIES — Research & Engineering Experiments**

Exploratory systems designed to demonstrate engineering thinking.

- **RVisionT** — Two-phase OCR pipeline (Python + OpenCV + Tesseract)

Focus:
- Stability over brute force
- Heuristic scoring
- Search-space reduction
- Failure control strategies


🛠 **X-LAB — Automation Utilities**

Small, focused tools solving practical OS-level problems.

- screen_hotkey_listener (WinAPI hotkeys + runtime C#)
- toggle_power (native Windows power scheme switch)

Minimal. Direct. Functional.

Software is not just code.
It is structure, discipline, and long-term thinking.
